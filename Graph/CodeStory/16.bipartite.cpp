//bipartite imagine having 2 colours, and you have to colour all the nodes with then such that no two adjacent nodes have the same colour
//a -> b , a -> c == bipartite graph -> 
//a -> b , a -> c , b -> c != not
//not the above is also cyclic with odd no. of nodes/edges

// Odd cycle length is a bipartite graph
